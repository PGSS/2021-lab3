## Dice 1000 Six Dice, a party game.

The rules of six dice are as followed.

At the beginning of your turn you roll six dice.

Dice have scores as follows:

- 1's are 100 points
- 5's are 50 points
- 3 of a kind are 200,300,400,500, etc. EXCEPT 1's which are 1000
- a straight (1,2,3,4,5,6) is worth 1500 points

After your roll, you must keep at least 1 of your dice which scores points, and you may keep as many scoring dice as you choose. The remaining dice can be rerolled for more points. If, however, on your next roll you get 0 points, your turn ends and you lose all the points you've collected. If ALL of your dice score points, you may reroll all six dice again, if you choose. Your turn ends when you decide to stop, or when you roll for no-points. 

You must roll at least 1000 points on a single turn, before your score may begin to accumulate. The game ends when the first player reaches 10,000 points
